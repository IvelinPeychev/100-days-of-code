# The deck is unlimited in size.
# There are no jokers.
# The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
# The Ace can count as 11 or 1.
# Use the following list as the deck of cards:
# cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
# The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
# Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
# The computer is the dealer.


cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
